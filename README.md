WORD COUNTER

The Word Counter project is a Java-based application designed to analyze a text file and generate a frequency report of unique words. 
The application uses BufferedReader and FileInputStream to read the file content efficiently and processes the data by cleaning and splitting the text into words.
It calculates the frequency of each word and sorts them in ascending order. 
A simple GUI built with JFrame, JLabel, JTextField, and JTextArea allows users to input the file path and view the frequency report directly in the application.
This project demonstrates the integration of file handling, text processing, and GUI development in Java.
